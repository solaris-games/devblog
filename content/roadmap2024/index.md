Hey everyone!

As promised in the last post, here is a rough roadmap regarding the features planned for Solaris in the rest of 2024.

Of course, that doesn't mean that there won't be numerous suggestions, features, little improvements and bugfixes being implemented, these are just the very major topics to focus on.
The goal is still to make the development process more transparent by creating a public task managment system, I'll continue to look into this.

## Roadmap

### Second quartal

Since this only spans roughly one more month, the primary goal is shipping the next releases that will bring bugfixes and some features, especially those with outstanding PRs on GitHub:

- Attack notifications
- Scheduled bulk upgrades
- First tutorial puzzles

### Third quartal

These features were frequently requested during the community poll, and I believe them to be important as well. Map generation will especially focus on improving the generation of the irregular map type.

- Better map generation
- Allow more flexible game modes by splitting visibility from stats collection
- Improvements to the new player experience
- Additional experimental specialists
- Several technical improvements

### Fourth quartal

Exporting games and replaying them seems good and useful, both to commemorate older games or to create content. However, there are some technical prequisites that must be solved, which is why this feature cannot land before they are implemented.
There have been several complaints about the UI in the past, and I can definitely see some areas for improvement. Also we have some technical troubles with the libraries used. As far as possible, the UI should get some improvements during this time.

- Game exporting (replays)
- Focus on UI and UX improvements by improving both the design and features
- Improvements to notifications

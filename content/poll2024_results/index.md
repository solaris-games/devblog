Hey everyone!

we had a community pol in the last weeks to gather some statistics, ideas for improvements and to further guide the development process of Solaris.

First, I'd like to thank everyone who participated! We got 81 response which is a good number!

In this post, I'd like to share some of the statistical results and first conclusions.

## Statistical results

### How long have you been playing Solaris?

### Do you frequent the Solaris discord?

Interesting to see that 25% of players are not on the discord!

Since the discord is marketed relatively heavily, it also means that I think something should be done to improve communication with the non-discord playerbase.

### How did you discover Solaris?

*Only popular responses shown*

Surprisingly few people came from Steam. There are definitely some things that could be done to market Solaris more beyond those coming over from similar games.

### How frequently do you play Solaris on the following devices:

Overall, there are 3 players playing mobile-only and 2 players never checking Solaris on their mobile phone.

### Do you use the Solaris Steam client?

To be honest, there is not much of a point to using the Steam client since the experience is identical to the website, except if you want to know how much time you spend desparately staring at the galaxy map.

### Do you use the Solaris mobile app for Android?

### Would you be interested in a Solaris app for iOS?

That's quite a number, would be nice to have (and is certainly possible to make). Would be nice to have a better UI though before expanding on the mobile offerings (and native notifications would be nice too).

### What is your opinion on the following statements:

### What game mode do you enjoy the most?

I abridged the responses, but besides specific special game modes, there were asks for larger turn-based games.

### Would you like to see an official game mode added?

*Addressing that later since it's a bunch of suggestions, I've noted them*

### Would you be interested in more frequent 48 or 64 player games?

![Would you be interested in more frequent 48 or 64 player games?](chart13.png)

That's quite a number of people. I think we should have one again this year, but I feel like there are some things that need improvement. More on that later.

### What is one feature that you'd love to see added to Solaris?

*Addressing that later*

### What community events would you like to see in the next year?

Frequent answers were:
- Large games
- Team games
- Guild games
- Tournaments and competitions
- Custom maps

Honorary mention for "intergalactic bagpipes". That will need some looking into until it can be arranged.

### Anything else you'd like to say?

A number of suggestions for both the game and community that have been taken notice of.
Also, a lot of really nice messages, thanks for that!
